# Project Resources  

These resources are meant to help you **learn step by step** the tools and languages we’ll be using in this project. You don’t need to know everything immediately — the goal is to build up skills as we go.  

If you’re starting from scratch, focus first on **items 1, 2, 3, and 4** (JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Tailwind, Supabase). Those are core to our project. After that, move into **items 7 and 8** (SQL + AWS) since they’re also very likely to be needed.

## 1. JavaScript & TypeScript (Core App Language)  

Start here. Everything in our project depends on being comfortable with JavaScript. Once you feel good about that, move on to TypeScript, which adds safety and clarity to our code.  

**Step 1: JavaScript Basics**  
- [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) – official, in-depth beginner resource.  
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) – approachable explanations and exercises.
- [Traversy Media Vanilla Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX) - the first video most importantly, as well as the next 4 are really good!

**Step 2: Level Up With TypeScript**  
- [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) – official docs.  
- [TypeScript for Beginners (Fireship)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp5H0Vw39yw) – quick 10-minute intro.

## 2. React (Frontend Framework)  

React is how we’ll build our UI. Once you know JS/TS, this is your next stop.  

**Step 1: Learn the Basics**  
- [React Official Docs](https://react.dev/learn) – interactive, modern docs.  
- [React Crash Course (Traversy Media)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8) – fast video intro.

## 3. Tailwind CSS (Styling)  

Tailwind lets us style our app quickly with utility classes. This makes it easy to create a polished interface without writing lots of custom CSS.  

**Step 1: Understand the Basics**  
- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) – core reference.  
- [Tailwind Crash Course (Traversy Media)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFgzHOX84xQ) – beginner-friendly intro.  

**Step 2: Play Around**  
- [Tailwind Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/) – experiment live without setup.

## 4. Supabase (Database + Auth)  

Supabase is our backend for storing user data, session logs, and authentication.  

**Step 1: Get Familiar**  
- [Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs) – official documentation.  

**Step 2: Build Something Small**  
- [Supabase Crash Course (Google Login Button)]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ1fJ7KVO1c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SEz6SK_ekE&pp=ygUqY29ubmVjdGluZyBzaWduIGluIHdpdGggZ29vZ2xlIG9uIHN1cGFiYXNl0gcJCfsJAYcqIYzv)) – quickstart video showing how to wire Supabase into a frontend app with google oauth.

## 5. MediaPipe / TensorFlow.js (Hand Tracking AI)  

We’ll use this for camera-based exercise tracking. You don’t need to go deep into ML theory — just understand how to use the APIs.  

**Step 1: MediaPipe Hands**  
- [Docs](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker/web_js) – official guide for browser hand tracking.  
- [Hand Tracking in Browser (Nicholas Renotte)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZde8Xt78Iw) – walkthrough of setup + use.  

**Step 2: TensorFlow.js (Optional Expansion)**  
- [Docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) – official docs.  
- [Crash Course (Fireship)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_XM3Bu-4yc) – short video intro.

## 6. Charting Libraries (Stock-Style Graphs)  

For visualizing accuracy and grip strength over time.  

**Step 1: Learn a Charting Library**  
- [Recharts Docs](https://recharts.org/en-US/examples) – best choice for React apps.  
- [Chart.js Docs](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) – popular alternative, slightly more general.

## 7. SQL (Schema & Professional Workflow)  

Even though Supabase handles database setup, it’s important to understand the SQL underneath.  

**Step 1: Learn the Basics**  
- [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) – interactive lessons.  

**Step 2: Dive Into PostgreSQL**  
- [PostgreSQL Tutorial](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/) – deeper dive into the flavor of SQL Supabase uses.  

---

## 8. AWS (Hosting & Deployment)  

This is where our app will live. Focus on deployment after you’ve built working features.  

**Step 1: Intro to AWS**  
- [AWS Free Tier Intro](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/) – official getting started guide.  

**Step 2: Deploy a React/Next.js App**  
- [Deploy Next.js on AWS EC2 (Tech With Tim)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQH5j7UO72o) – simple walkthrough of hosting a frontend on EC2.
