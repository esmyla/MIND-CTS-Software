# CTS-Glove Project 

## Overview  
The CTS-Glove Project is a rehabilitation support platform designed to assist patients with **carpal tunnel syndrome** and related conditions. By combining **computer vision**, **wearable sensors**, and a **cloud-hosted dashboard**, the system empowers patients and clinicians to track therapy exercises, monitor progress, and gain actionable insights into recovery.  

Our software team is building an **AWS-hosted application** that integrates real-time camera-based tracking with sensor data from a custom glove, creating a unified tool for **visualizing, tracking, and analyzing rehabilitation data**.

## Project Goals  

1. **Camera-Based Exercise Tracking**  
   - Use hand-tracking AI (MediaPipe / TensorFlow.js) to monitor therapy exercises.  
   - Provide accuracy metrics for each attempt.  
   - Visualize exercise performance trends over time with intuitive graphs.  

2. **Grip Strength Monitoring**  
   - Capture grip force data from glove FSR sensors.  
   - Track progression session by session.  
   - Display stock-style graphs to show long-term improvement.  

3. **Heart Rate & Exertion Analysis**  
   - Monitor heart rate during exercises.  
   - Combine exertion and strength into a **single recovery metric**.  
   - Help clinicians understand both effort and performance together.  

4. **Unified Dashboard**  
   - Provide patients and clinicians with a central hub for all data.  
   - Make metrics easy to interpret with clean, modern visualizations.  
   - Ensure data is stored, persistent, and accessible.

## Roadmap  

- **Phase 1:** Core infrastructure (AWS, Supabase, authentication).  
- **Phase 2:** Camera-based hand tracking prototype.  
- **Phase 3:** Grip strength sensor integration.  
- **Phase 4:** Heart rate & exertion metrics.  
- **Phase 5:** Unified dashboard, visual refinements, and testing.

## Impact  

The CTS-Glove Project aims to **transform physical therapy for carpal tunnel patients** by:  
- Making **therapy progress measurable** instead of subjective.  
- Providing patients with **motivating visual feedback** that mirrors familiar stock-style performance charts.  
- Giving clinicians **quantitative insights** into both recovery strength and exertion levels.  
- Enabling **remote monitoring and support**, helping patients stay on track outside the clinic.  

Ultimately, this project bridges the gap between **hardware sensors, computer vision, and intuitive software design** to create a powerful tool for rehabilitation â€” one that could be adapted for a wide range of physical therapy applications beyond carpal tunnel treatment.
